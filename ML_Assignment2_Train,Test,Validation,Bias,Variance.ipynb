    "Overfitting occurs when a model learns training data too well, leading to poor generalization. It can be mitigated by increasing training data, feature selection, regularization, and cross-validation. Underfitting happens when a model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns. It can be addressed by using more complex models and increasing model capacity."
